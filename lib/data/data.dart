This turns into story that is told by many more people. It then grows into a more structured change initiative or even a movement. Change starts small, but we all have the capacity to sense future possibilities—small or large. Challenging the impossible and seeing new possibilities is a faculty that we can cultivate. It can become a habit to see the glass half full rather than half empty. Inspiring others to access their own creative potential follows naturally.',
