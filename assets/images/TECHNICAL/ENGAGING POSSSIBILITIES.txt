Engaging with the future is not about denying the past, or ignoring the present. Both take us into the future when we are prepared to learn und inquire into meaning. This becomes the fertile ground for taking dreams into reality. For Grace Lee Boggs it is the paradigm shift to a solidarity economy that serves, individuals, communities and the planet.

Every change endeavour starts with people seeing future possibilities—sometimes it is an individual grasping the potential of an idea, sometimes it is a group of people who develop a vision for a future state. This turns into story that is told by many more people. It then grows into a more structured change initiative or even a movement. Change starts small, but we all have the capacity to sense future possibilities—small or large. Challenging the “impossible” and seeing new possibilities is a faculty that we can cultivate. It can become a habit to see the glass half full rather than half empty. Inspiring others to access their own creative potential follows naturally.
