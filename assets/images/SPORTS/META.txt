Meta events are displayed in the event assistant, framing the actual dynamic event that marks the state of the meta event. They stand out because they are displayed even if no events are currently running. However, unlike dynamic events, meta events are neither completed nor do they provide experience points or rewards of their own. However, if players succeed at certain meta events, hidden areas of the world may become accessible for a period of time.
