Are you ready to engage your attendees in a new and different way? QUICKFIRE is a fun, competitive and challenging team event using a technology interface to guide the teams through the activity. With nearly 100 tasks spread over 3 difficulty levels, there is plenty to do.

In Quickfire, successful teams work effectively together to weigh up risk and reward. With time ticking, participants must speak up and let the rest of the team know what challenges they can confidently answer. Trust builds as challenges are completed successfully and individuals learn to appreciate each otherâ€™s different abilities.

Group challenges require teams to employ innovative thinking. They must utilize effective communication skills to arrive at a collective shared strategy and then jump into swift uninhibited action.
