An open mic or open mike (shortened from "open microphone") is a live show at a venue such as a coffeehouse, nightclub, comedy club, strip club, or pub, usually taking place at night, in which audience members may perform on stage whether they are amateurs or professionals, often for the first time or to promote an upcoming performance.[1] As the name suggests, performers are usually provided with a microphone plugged into a PA system so that they can be heard by the audience.
